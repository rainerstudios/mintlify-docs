# Setting Up Automatic Server Backups

Regular backups are crucial for protecting your game server data. This guide explains how to set up, manage, and restore backups using the XGamingServer control panel.

## Backup System Overview

The XGamingServer backup system allows you to:
- Create manual backups at any time
- Schedule automatic backups at regular intervals
- Download backups to your local computer
- Restore backups to your server
- Configure backup rotation policies

## Creating Manual Backups

To create a backup immediately:

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Select your game server
3. Navigate to the **Backups** tab
4. Click the **Create Backup** button
5. Enter an optional name for your backup (recommended for easy identification)
6. Select which folders/files to include
7. Click **Create Backup**

<Note>
  Creating a backup may temporarily increase server load. For large servers, we recommend scheduling backups during low-activity periods.
</Note>

## Setting Up Scheduled Backups

To set up automatic backups:

1. Go to the **Schedules** tab in your server's control panel
2. Click **Create Schedule**
3. Select **Backup** as the task type
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Give your backup schedule a descriptive name
   - **Frequency**: Choose how often the backup should run
   - **First Run**: Set when the first backup should occur
   - **Files to backup**: Select which directories to include
   - **Backup retention**: How many backups to keep before rotation

### Recommended Backup Frequencies

| Server Type | Recommended Frequency | Retention |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Low activity | Weekly | 4 backups |
| Medium activity | Twice weekly | 6 backups |
| High activity | Daily | 7 backups |
| Mission critical | Twice daily | 10 backups |

## Managing Your Backups

All your backups are listed in the **Backups** tab. For each backup, you can:

- **Download**: Save the backup to your local computer
- **Restore**: Restore this backup to your server
- **Lock**: Prevent the backup from being automatically deleted during rotation
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the backup

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will overwrite existing files on your server. Make sure you have a backup of your current state before restoring an older backup.
</Warning>

## Backup Rotation

Backup rotation helps manage storage space by automatically removing old backups. Here's how it works:

1. You set the maximum number of backups to keep (retention policy)
2. When this limit is reached, the oldest unlocked backup is deleted
3. Locked backups are never automatically deleted

To lock an important backup:
1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to protect
3. Click the **Lock** icon

<Tip>
  Lock important backups like those taken before major updates or significant server changes.
</Tip>

## Restoring From a Backup

To restore your server from a backup:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to restore
3. Click the **Restore** button
4. Confirm the restoration

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will stop your server during the process. Players will be disconnected until the restoration is complete and the server is restarted.
</Warning>

The restoration process:
1. Stops the game server
2. Extracts the backup
3. Replaces the current files with the backup files
4. Restarts the server (if it was running before)

## Downloading Backups

To download a backup to your computer:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to download
3. Click the **Download** button
4. Save the file to your preferred location

<Note>
  Backups are compressed archives. You'll need a program like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or a similar utility to extract them.
</Note>

## Best Practices for Server Backups

- **Multiple backup schedules**: Consider having both daily and weekly backup schedules
- **Test your backups**: Periodically restore a backup in a test environment to ensure it works
- **External storage**: Download important backups to your local computer for extra safety
- **Document changes**: Add notes to your backups describing major server changes
- **Pre-update backups**: Always create a backup before installing updates or making significant changes

## Troubleshooting Backup Issues

### Backup Creation Fails

If your backup fails to create:
1. Check if you have sufficient storage space on your server plan
2. Ensure the server isn't experiencing excessive load
3. Try creating a backup with fewer files/directories
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Backup Restoration Fails

If your backup fails to restore:
1. Verify the backup file isn't corrupted
2. Check server logs for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have sufficient storage space for the restored files
4. Try restarting the server before attempting restoration again
