# SFTP Server Connection Guide

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) provides a secure way to transfer files between your computer and your game server. This guide will walk you through setting up and using an SFTP connection.

## What You'll Need

- Your server's SFTP credentials (available in your XGamingServer control panel)

## Finding Your SFTP Credentials

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Select your game server
3. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
4. Look for the **SFTP Details** section

You'll need the following information:

### Uploading Files to Your Server

1. Navigate to the desired folder on your server
2. Find the file(s) you want to upload on your local computer
3. Drag and drop the file(s) from the left panel to the right panel
4. Wait for the transfer to complete

### Downloading Files from Your Server

1. Navigate to the folder containing the files you want to download
2. Select the file(s) on the server side (right panel)
3. Drag and drop the file(s) from the right panel to the left panel
4. Wait for the transfer to complete

## Common File Operations

- **Create a new folder**: Right-click in the file browser and select "Create directory"
- **Delete files/folders**: Right-click on the item and select "Delete"
- **Rename files/folders**: Right-click on the item and select "Rename"
- **Edit files**: Right-click on a file and select "View/Edit" (if your SFTP client supports it)

## Setting File Permissions

Some game servers require specific file permissions to function correctly:

1. Right-click on the file/folder
2. Select "File permissions" or "Properties"
3. Adjust the permissions as needed
   - Most files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
   - Most folders: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
   - Executable files: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)

<Warning>
  Incorrect file permissions can cause your server to malfunction. If you're unsure about changing permissions, consult your game's documentation or contact support.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting SFTP Connections

### Cannot Connect to Server

1. Verify your credentials are correct
2. Check if the server is online
3. Ensure your firewall isn't blocking the SFTP port
4. Try connecting with a different SFTP client

### Slow Transfer Speeds

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try transferring smaller batches of files
3. Use compression if your SFTP client supports it
4. Consider using a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi

### Connection Timeout

1. Check your internet stability
2. Increase the timeout setting in your SFTP client
3. Try reconnecting during off-peak hours
