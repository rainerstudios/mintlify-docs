# Importing Content from WordPress

This guide explains how to import content from your WordPress site into the XGamingServer documentation.

## Prerequisites

- A WordPress XML export file
- Linux/WSL environment with `xmlstarlet` installed
- Basic command line knowledge

## Step 1: Export WordPress Content

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to Tools > Export
3. Choose to export "All content"
4. Download the XML file

## Step 2: Run the Import Script

1. Place the WordPress XML export file in the same directory as the `import-from-wordpress.sh` script
2. Update the `WORDPRESS_EXPORT_FILE` variable in the script to match your export filename
3. Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x import-from-wordpress.sh
./import-from-wordpress.sh
```

## Step 3: Organize Imported Content

1. The script will create a `wordpress_content` directory with MDX files
2. Review each file and move it to the appropriate game directory
3. Rename files according to the guide structure (e.g., `setup.mdx`, `configuration.mdx`)
4. Update any internal links or image paths

## Step 4: Process Images

1. Download images from your WordPress site
2. Place them in the appropriate `images/games/[game-name]` directories
3. Update image references in MDX files from WordPress URL to local path

## Step 5: Test the Documentation

1. Run `mintlify dev` to preview the documentation
2. Check that all imported content displays correctly
3. Fix any formatting issues or broken links
