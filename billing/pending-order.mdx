## Resolving a Pending Order

The steps to resolve a pending order depend on the reason for the pending status:

### For Payment Verification

Most payment verifications resolve automatically within 30 minutes. If your order has been pending for longer:

1. Check your email for any verification requests from our payment processor
2. Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds
3. Ensure your billing address matches the address on file with your payment provider

### For Manual Review Orders

If your order requires manual review:

1. Check your email for any requests for additional information
2. Respond promptly to any verification emails
3. Contact our billing team if you haven't received any communication within 12 hours

### For Resource Allocation Delays

Resource allocation typically happens automatically, but during high-demand periods:

1. Wait for the automated process to complete (usually within 30 minutes)
2. Check your order status occasionally for updates
3. Contact support if the status doesn't change after 1 hour
