## Why Accounts Get Suspended

Accounts may be suspended for several reasons:

### 1. Payment Issues

The most common reason for suspension is payment failure, which can occur due to:
- Expired credit card
- Insufficient funds
- Failed PayPal subscription
- Billing information errors
- Disputed charges or chargebacks

### 2. Terms of Service Violations

Violations that may lead to suspension include:
- Hosting prohibited content
- Server resource abuse
- Unauthorized penetration testing
- DDoS attacks originating from your server
- Using the service for illegal activities

### 3. Compliance Issues

Sometimes suspensions occur due to:
- Incomplete verification information
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- DMCA takedown notices
- Law enforcement requests

## The Suspension Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Warning notification">
    Before suspension, we attempt to notify you about impending issues via email. This is why keeping your contact information updated is crucial.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service suspension">
    If the issue isn't resolved, your service will be suspended. During suspension:
    - Your server will be inaccessible
    - Control panel access is limited
    - Your data remains intact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification of suspension">
    We send an email explaining the reason for suspension and steps to resolve it.

  <Step title="Resolution period">
    You typically have 7-14 days to resolve the issue before the account moves toward termination. The exact timeframe depends on the nature of the suspension.
  </Step>

### For Policy Violation Suspensions

1. Review the suspension email for specific violation details
2. Address the violation by removing prohibited content or stopping the problematic activity
3. Contact support at [support@xgamingserver.com](mailto:support@xgamingserver.com) to explain the steps you've taken
4. Wait for account review (typically 24-48 hours)

## The Termination Process

Termination occurs when:
- A suspension isn't resolved within the given timeframe
- Multiple, repeated violations occur
- Severe terms of service violations are detected
- Account holder requests voluntary termination

<Warning>
  Termination results in the permanent deletion of all your server data, including world saves, configurations, and user data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

The termination process typically follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Final notice">
    Before termination, we send a final notice giving you a last opportunity to resolve the issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service termination">
    If no resolution occurs, the service is terminated and queued for data deletion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data deletion">
    All server data is permanently deleted within 48-72 hours after termination.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Account closure">
    The account is marked as closed in our system.
  </Step>
</Steps>
