# How to Cancel Your Service

If you need to cancel your XGamingServer service, this guide will walk you through the process. Before proceeding, consider if [pausing your server](./pause-server) might be a better option if you plan to return later.

<Warning>
  Canceling your service will result in the permanent deletion of all server data, including game files, configurations, and world saves. This action cannot be undone.
