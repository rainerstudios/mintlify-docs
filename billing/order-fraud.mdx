# Why Was My Order Status Listed as Fraud

If your order has been flagged as potentially fraudulent, don't worryâ€”this is a protective measure that can be resolved. This guide explains why orders get flagged, what it means, and how to get your order approved.

## Why Orders Get Flagged as Potential Fraud

## What Happens When an Order is Flagged

When an order is flagged for potential fraud:

1. **Order Status**: Your order status changes to "Fraud Review" in your client area
2. **Service Status**: Your server is not provisioned until the review is complete
3. **Notification**: You receive an email notification about the review
4. **Payment Hold**: Your payment is authorized but not fully processed
5. **Manual Review**: Our fraud prevention team reviews your order

## How to Resolve a Fraud Flag

If your order has been flagged for fraud review, here's how to get it resolved quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    Look for an email with the subject "Order Verification Required" in your inbox and spam folder. This email contains important information about next steps.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reply with verification">
    Respond to the verification email with the requested identification information, which may include:
    
    - A copy of your ID (driver's license, passport, or national ID)
    - A photo of the payment card used (showing only the last 4 digits)
    - A utility bill or bank statement showing your billing address
    
    <Info>
      For privacy, you can blur out or cover sensitive information not required for verification.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete verification form">
    In some cases, you may be directed to complete a secure verification form instead of sending documents via email.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Our fraud prevention team will review your information, typically within 1-12 hours during business hours.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order approval">
    Once verified, your order will be approved, and your server will be provisioned automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expediting the Review Process

To get your order approved faster:

1. **Provide clear information**: Ensure all verification documents are clear and readable
2. **Respond quickly**: Prompt responses speed up the verification process
3. **Use official documents**: Government-issued IDs are preferred for verification
4. **Contact support**: If you haven't received a response within 24 hours, contact our support team

## Preventing Future Fraud Flags

To avoid having future orders flagged:

- **Use consistent information**: Ensure billing address matches your payment method's registered address
- **Disable VPN**: Turn off VPN or proxy services when placing orders
- **Verify payment details**: Double-check that all payment information is accurate
- **Use verified payment methods**: Previously verified payment methods are less likely to trigger flags
- **Update your profile**: Keep your account information current and accurate

## If Your Order Is Declined

In some cases, after review, an order may still be declined if:

- Verification documents could not be validated
- High-risk indicators could not be resolved
- Payment processor enforced restrictions
- Discrepancies could not be explained

If your legitimate order is declined, please contact our billing team directly at [billing@xgamingserver.com](mailto:billing@xgamingserver.com) with:

1. Your order number
2. A detailed explanation
3. Alternative payment method (if applicable)
4. Any additional verification you can provide
