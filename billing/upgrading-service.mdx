# Upgrading Your Service

As your server grows in popularity or your needs change, you may find that you need more resources. This guide explains how to upgrade your XGamingServer service to a higher plan.

## When to Upgrade Your Server

Consider upgrading your server if you're experiencing:

- **Performance issues**: Lag, slow loading times, or server crashes
- **Memory warnings**: Frequent "out of memory" errors in your logs
- **CPU bottlenecks**: High CPU usage consistently above 80%
- **Disk space limitations**: Running out of storage space
- **Player capacity issues**: Unable to accommodate your growing community

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the upgrade details">
    Before confirming, review:
    - Price difference
    - New billing amount
    - Prorated charges (if applicable)
    - Resource changes
    - Effective date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and complete payment">
    Click the "Upgrade" button and complete any required payment for the upgrade. In many cases, you'll only pay the prorated difference between your current plan and the new plan.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server upgrade process">
    After confirmation, your server will begin the upgrade process:
    1. You'll receive a confirmation email
    2. Your server may experience a brief downtime during the upgrade
    3. Once complete, your server will restart with the new resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Prorated Billing for Upgrades

When you upgrade mid-billing cycle, we calculate prorated charges to ensure you only pay for what you use:

1. You receive a credit for the unused portion of your current plan
2. You're charged for the new plan from the upgrade date until the end of your billing cycle

<Info>
  Prorated charges are calculated based on the number of days remaining in your current billing period. This ensures a fair and transparent upgrade process.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

In this example:
- Current plan: $20/month
- New plan: $30/month
- 15 days remaining in billing cycle (out of 30 days)
- Credit for unused portion: $10 (50% of $20)
- Charge for new plan: $15 (50% of $30)
- Total prorated charge: $5 ($15 - $10)

## Upgrade FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my server data be preserved during an upgrade?">
    Yes, all your server data, configurations, and game files are preserved during the upgrade process. However, we recommend creating a backup before any upgrade as a precaution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the upgrade process take?">
    Most upgrades are completed within 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your server and the extent of the upgrade. During this time, your server may be temporarily unavailable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade in the middle of my billing cycle?">
    Yes, you can upgrade at any time. We use prorated billing to ensure you only pay for the difference between your old and new plans for the remainder of your billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I need to downgrade later?">
    Downgrades follow a similar process but are typically scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. See our [changing plans](./changing-plans) guide for more information.
