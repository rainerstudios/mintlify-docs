# Suspensions and Terminations

This guide explains the difference between account suspensions and service terminations, why they occur, and what steps you can take to resolve these situations.

## Account Suspensions vs. Service Terminations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Account Suspension" icon="pause-circle">
    A temporary hold on your service due to payment issues or policy violations. Your data is preserved, and service can be restored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Termination" icon="ban">
    Permanent closure of your service and deletion of all associated data. This typically follows extended suspension or serious policy violations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Accounts Get Suspended

Accounts may be suspended for several reasons:

### 1. Payment Issues

The most common reason for suspension is payment failure, which can occur due to:
- Expired credit card
- Insufficient funds
- Failed PayPal subscription
- Billing information errors
- Disputed charges or chargebacks

### 2. Terms of Service Violations

Violations that may lead to suspension include:
- Hosting prohibited content
- Server resource abuse
- Unauthorized penetration testing
- DDoS attacks originating from your server
- Using the service for illegal activities

### 3. Compliance Issues

Sometimes suspensions occur due to:
- Incomplete verification information
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- DMCA takedown notices
- Law enforcement requests

## The Suspension Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Warning notification">
    Before suspension, we attempt to notify you about impending issues via email. This is why keeping your contact information updated is crucial.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service suspension">
    If the issue isn't resolved, your service will be suspended. During suspension:
    - Your server will be inaccessible
    - Control panel access is limited
    - Your data remains intact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification of suspension">
    We send an email explaining the reason for suspension and steps to resolve it.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/suspension-email.jpg" alt="Suspension Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution period">
    You typically have 7-14 days to resolve the issue before the account moves toward termination. The exact timeframe depends on the nature of the suspension.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolving a Suspension

The steps to resolve a suspension depend on the reason:

### For Payment-Related Suspensions

1. Log in to your [billing dashboard](https://panel.xgamingserver.com/billing)
2. Navigate to Invoices > Unpaid
3. Review and pay any outstanding invoices
4. Update your payment method if necessary
5. Contact billing if you need assistance with payment

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/payment-update.jpg" alt="Update Payment Method" />
</Frame>

### For Policy Violation Suspensions

1. Review the suspension email for specific violation details
2. Address the violation by removing prohibited content or stopping the problematic activity
3. Contact support at [support@xgamingserver.com](mailto:support@xgamingserver.com) to explain the steps you've taken
4. Wait for account review (typically 24-48 hours)

## The Termination Process

Termination occurs when:
- A suspension isn't resolved within the given timeframe
- Multiple, repeated violations occur
- Severe terms of service violations are detected
- Account holder requests voluntary termination

<Warning>
  Termination results in the permanent deletion of all your server data, including world saves, configurations, and user data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

The termination process typically follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Final notice">
    Before termination, we send a final notice giving you a last opportunity to resolve the issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service termination">
    If no resolution occurs, the service is terminated and queued for data deletion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data deletion">
    All server data is permanently deleted within 48-72 hours after termination.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Account closure">
    The account is marked as closed in our system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Appealing a Suspension or Termination

If you believe your account was suspended or terminated in error:

1. Gather any evidence supporting your appeal
2. Email our compliance team at [compliance@xgamingserver.com](mailto:compliance@xgamingserver.com)
3. Include your account ID and detailed explanation
4. Provide any relevant documentation
5. Allow 2-3 business days for review

## Preventative Measures

To avoid suspensions:

- Keep your payment information up to date
- Address warning emails promptly

- Respond to all official communications from XGamingServer
- Set up backup payment methods

# Why Was My Order Status Listed as Fraud

If your order has been flagged as potentially fraudulent, don't worryâ€”this is a protective measure that can be resolved. This guide explains why orders get flagged, what it means, and how to get your order approved.

## Why Orders Get Flagged as Potential Fraud

XGamingServer uses an automated fraud detection system to protect both customers and our business. Orders may be flagged for various reasons:

### Common Flag Triggers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Location Mismatch" icon="globe">
    Your IP address location differs significantly from your billing address
  </Card>
  <Card title="High-Risk Regions" icon="map-pin">
    Order placed from regions with historically high fraud rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mismatched Information" icon="id-card">
    Discrepancies between provided information and payment provider data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Failed Attempts" icon="repeat">
    Several failed payment attempts before successful payment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unusual Purchase Pattern" icon="chart-line">
    Order pattern differs from typical customer behavior
  </Card>
  <Card title="VPN/Proxy Usage" icon="mask">
    Order placed through VPN or proxy service
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Being flagged for fraud review does NOT mean we believe you are committing fraud. It's simply a security measure to verify legitimate orders and protect your payment information.
</Note>

## What Happens When an Order is Flagged

When an order is flagged for potential fraud:

1. **Order Status**: Your order status changes to "Fraud Review" in your client area
2. **Service Status**: Your server is not provisioned until the review is complete
3. **Notification**: You receive an email notification about the review
4. **Payment Hold**: Your payment is authorized but not fully processed
5. **Manual Review**: Our fraud prevention team reviews your order

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/fraud-review-status.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Status Example" />
</Frame>

## How to Resolve a Fraud Flag

If your order has been flagged for fraud review, here's how to get it resolved quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    Look for an email with the subject "Order Verification Required" in your inbox and spam folder. This email contains important information about next steps.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/fraud-email.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reply with verification">
    Respond to the verification email with the requested identification information, which may include:
    
    - A copy of your ID (driver's license, passport, or national ID)
    - A photo of the payment card used (showing only the last 4 digits)
    - A utility bill or bank statement showing your billing address
    
    <Info>
      For privacy, you can blur out or cover sensitive information not required for verification.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete verification form">
    In some cases, you may be directed to complete a secure verification form instead of sending documents via email.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Our fraud prevention team will review your information, typically within 1-12 hours during business hours.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order approval">
    Once verified, your order will be approved, and your server will be provisioned automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expediting the Review Process

To get your order approved faster:

1. **Provide clear information**: Ensure all verification documents are clear and readable
2. **Respond quickly**: Prompt responses speed up the verification process
3. **Use official documents**: Government-issued IDs are preferred for verification
4. **Contact support**: If you haven't received a response within 24 hours, contact our support team

## Preventing Future Fraud Flags

To avoid having future orders flagged:

- **Use consistent information**: Ensure billing address matches your payment method's registered address
- **Disable VPN**: Turn off VPN or proxy services when placing orders
- **Verify payment details**: Double-check that all payment information is accurate
- **Use verified payment methods**: Previously verified payment methods are less likely to trigger flags
- **Update your profile**: Keep your account information current and accurate

## If Your Order Is Declined

In some cases, after review, an order may still be declined if:

- Verification documents could not be validated
- High-risk indicators could not be resolved
- Payment processor enforced restrictions
- Discrepancies could not be explained

If your legitimate order is declined, please contact our billing team directly at [billing@xgamingserver.com](mailto:billing@xgamingserver.com) with:

1. Your order number
2. A detailed explanation
3. Alternative payment method (if applicable)
4. Any additional verification you can provide

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I be charged for an order under fraud review?">
    Your payment method will show an authorization hold, but you won't be charged until the order is approved. If the order is declined, the authorization is released.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the verification process take?">
    Most verifications are completed within 1-12 hours during business hours. Complex cases may take up to 24 hours.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I place a new order instead of waiting for verification?">
    We recommend waiting for the verification process to complete. Creating multiple orders may trigger additional fraud flags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my personal information secure during verification?">
    Yes, all verification documents are handled according to our Privacy Policy, stored securely, and deleted after verification is complete.
  </Accordion>

# Upgrading Your Service

As your server grows in popularity or your needs change, you may find that you need more resources. This guide explains how to upgrade your XGamingServer service to a higher plan.

## When to Upgrade Your Server

Consider upgrading your server if you're experiencing:

- **Performance issues**: Lag, slow loading times, or server crashes
- **Memory warnings**: Frequent "out of memory" errors in your logs
- **CPU bottlenecks**: High CPU usage consistently above 80%
- **Disk space limitations**: Running out of storage space
- **Player capacity issues**: Unable to accommodate your growing community

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-indicators.jpg" alt="Server Resource Indicators" />
</Frame>

## Understanding Your Upgrade Options

XGamingServer offers several upgrade paths:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vertical Scaling" icon="arrow-up">
    Increase RAM, CPU, and storage on your existing server
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add-On Services" icon="puzzle-piece">

    Upgrade to premium tiers with additional features
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Solutions" icon="sliders">
    Tailor-made configurations for specific needs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Upgrade Your Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Go to the [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com) and log in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to your services">
    Click on "Billing" in the main navigation, then select "Services" from the dropdown menu.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/billing-services-menu.jpg" alt="Billing Services Menu" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the server to upgrade">
    Locate the server you wish to upgrade and click the "Manage" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access upgrade options">
    Look for the "Upgrade/Downgrade" or "Change Plan" button, typically located in the service details page.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-button.jpg" alt="Upgrade Button" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your new plan">

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/plan-comparison.jpg" alt="Plan Comparison" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the upgrade details">
    Before confirming, review:
    - Price difference
    - New billing amount
    - Prorated charges (if applicable)
    - Resource changes
    - Effective date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and complete payment">
    Click the "Upgrade" button and complete any required payment for the upgrade. In many cases, you'll only pay the prorated difference between your current plan and the new plan.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server upgrade process">
    After confirmation, your server will begin the upgrade process:
    1. You'll receive a confirmation email
    2. Your server may experience a brief downtime during the upgrade
    3. Once complete, your server will restart with the new resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Prorated Billing for Upgrades

When you upgrade mid-billing cycle, we calculate prorated charges to ensure you only pay for what you use:

1. You receive a credit for the unused portion of your current plan
2. You're charged for the new plan from the upgrade date until the end of your billing cycle

<Info>
  Prorated charges are calculated based on the number of days remaining in your current billing period. This ensures a fair and transparent upgrade process.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/proration-example.jpg" alt="Proration Example" />
</Frame>

In this example:
- Current plan: $20/month
- New plan: $30/month
- 15 days remaining in billing cycle (out of 30 days)
- Credit for unused portion: $10 (50% of $20)
- Charge for new plan: $15 (50% of $30)
- Total prorated charge: $5 ($15 - $10)

## Upgrade FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my server data be preserved during an upgrade?">
    Yes, all your server data, configurations, and game files are preserved during the upgrade process. However, we recommend creating a backup before any upgrade as a precaution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the upgrade process take?">
    Most upgrades are completed within 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your server and the extent of the upgrade. During this time, your server may be temporarily unavailable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade in the middle of my billing cycle?">
    Yes, you can upgrade at any time. We use prorated billing to ensure you only pay for the difference between your old and new plans for the remainder of your billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I need to downgrade later?">
    Downgrades follow a similar process but are typically scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. See our [changing plans](./changing-plans) guide for more information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# I Ordered Service and It Is Pending

If you've placed an order with XGamingServer and notice that it's in a "Pending" status, don't worryâ€”this is a normal part of the order process in certain situations. This guide explains why orders may be pending and what steps you can take to resolve this status.

## Why Orders Show as Pending

There are several common reasons why an order might be in a pending status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Payment Verification" icon="credit-card">
    Your payment method is being verified by our payment processor
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Review" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Your order has been flagged for manual review by our team
  </Card>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Fraud Protection" icon="shield">
    Routine security checks are being performed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Order Statuses

XGamingServer uses several status labels to track orders:

|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Pending | Order received but not yet processed | 5-30 minutes |
| Fraud Check | Order flagged for security verification | 1-12 hours |
| Processing | Order approved and being set up | 5-15 minutes |
| Active | Server is set up and ready to use | N/A |
| Failed | Order could not be processed | N/A |

## Resolving a Pending Order

The steps to resolve a pending order depend on the reason for the pending status:

### For Payment Verification

Most payment verifications resolve automatically within 30 minutes. If your order has been pending for longer:

1. Check your email for any verification requests from our payment processor
2. Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds
3. Ensure your billing address matches the address on file with your payment provider

### For Manual Review Orders

If your order requires manual review:

1. Check your email for any requests for additional information
2. Respond promptly to any verification emails
3. Contact our billing team if you haven't received any communication within 12 hours

### For Resource Allocation Delays

Resource allocation typically happens automatically, but during high-demand periods:

1. Wait for the automated process to complete (usually within 30 minutes)
2. Check your order status occasionally for updates
3. Contact support if the status doesn't change after 1 hour

## Expediting Your Pending Order

If you need your server urgently, here are steps to expedite the process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for verification emails">
    First, check your email (including spam folder) for any verification requests that might be holding up your order.
